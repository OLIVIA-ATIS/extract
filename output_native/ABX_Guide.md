involving a total of 79 patients with pneumococcal meningitis treated with either penicillin plus tetracyclines or penicillin monotherapy there was a higher mortality rate (79-85%) in the combination therapy compared to penicillin monotherapy (30-33%). (Arch Intern Med 1951:88:489, Ann Intern Med 1961; 55:545). However there was not a difference in mortality between penicillin monotherapy and penicillin plus tetracycline in the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia. (Arch Intern Med 1953; 91:197).

PREGNANCY Risk: B-In surveillance study of Michigan Medicaid recipients, 556 newborns were exposed to clavulanate/penicillin during the first trimester; there were no associations between birth defects and clavulanate/penicillin.

Breast FEEDING: No studies with clavulanate.

ComMENTS: Oral betalactam w/ activity against common bacteria that produce beta- lactamases: e.g., H. influenzae, MSSA, Moraxella and all PCN-resistant anaerobes. Diarrhea is common due to both clavulanate & amoxicillin. The IDSA recommends amox/ clay if anaerobes or H. influenzae are suspected [CID 2000; 31:347]. No advantage using Augmentin XR over amox 1g PO tid for intermediately-resistant S. pneumoniae.

Dru INTERACTIONS

Digoxin: Potential increase in digitalis toxicity secondary to ampho-induced potassium depletion. Diuretics and steroids: May increase risk of hypokalemia. Nephrotoxic agents (Foscarnet, aminoglycosides, IV contrast, etc.): additive nephrotoxicity.

PREGNANCY Risk: B-A Collaborative Perinatal Project identified 9 first-trimester exposures to amphotericin and found no adverse fetal effects. Animal studies demonstrated amphotericin to be harmless in pregnancy.

Breast FEEDING: No data available.

CommeENTS: Parenteral use is complicated by high rate of infusion related reactions, anemia, electrolyte imbalance and renal failure. A switch to the lipid formulation is often not recommended until the creatinine is elevated to an arbitrary threshold (Scr >2.5 used at Hopkins). Infusion related side effects is worst with Amphotec [CID 2002; 35: 359]

Druc INTERACTIONS Allopurinol: Incidence of skin rash increased to 14-22% when the two are co-administered compared to 6-8% with ampicillin when administered alone or 2% when allopurinol is administered alone. Use alternative therapy if possible, if not beware of the increased incidence of rash when ampicillin and allopurinolare co-administered. Tetracyclines: In vitro antagonism when co-administered. Bactericidal effect of penicillins may be diminished in vivo. Avoid concurrent administration. In two studies involving a total of 79 patients with pneumococcal meningitis treated with either penicillin plus tetracyclines or penicillin monotherapy there was a higher mortality rate (79-85%) in the combination therapy compared to penicillin monotherapy (30-83%).

Breast FEEDING: Excreted in breast milk at low concentrations.

Druc INTERACTIONS

Substrate, inhibitor, and likely inducer of CYP3A4. CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase APV serum levels. CYP3A4 inducers may decrease APV serum levels. APV may increase or decrease serum levels of CYP3A4 substrates. Contraindicated with: terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, ergot alkaloid, rifampin,

PREGNANCY Risk: C-Placental passage unknown. Rat studies using half the human dose, resulted in thymic elongation and incomplete ossification of bones. Rabbit studies using one-twentieth of human therapeutic doses were associated with abortions and skeletal abnormalities. }

Breast FEEDING: No human data, breast milk excretion in animal studies. Breast feeding is not recommended in the U.S. in order to avoid post-natal transmission of HIV to the child, who may not yet be infected.

Comments: Avoid long term use of APV oral solution due to propylene glycol content. Fosamprenavir is the preferred formulation due to lower pill burden and better bioavailability.

Dru INTERACTIONS Atovaquone: Tetracycline (decreased atovaquone by 40%). Metoclopramide: Decreased atovaquone level. Proguanil component: No significant interactions noted. Rifampin: Decreased atovaquone by 50%; rifabutin decreases atovaquopne by 34%.

PREGNANCY Risk: C- atovaquone not teratogenic in rat studies. Maternal and fetal toxicities (decreased fetal weight, early fetal resorption and post-implantation fetal loss) reported in rabbits. No human data. Proguanil: not teratogenic in rat studies. In a study of 200 pregnant Nigerian women in the first two trimesters, proguanil 100mg/day resulted in reduction of parasitemia from 35% to 2%, reduction of anemia from 18% to 3% and increases in mean birth weights by 132g.

Anti-INrectives

Apverse Druc REACTIONS: Occasional: GI intolerance (in 4% of patients, but better tolerated than erythromycin); diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain; vaginitis; reversible hearing loss in 5% of pts with mean exposure of 59g.

Druc INTERACTIONS Cyclosporin: Azithromycin may (in one case report) interfere with the metabolism of cyclosporin therefore increasing the level of cyclosporin. Increase in cyclosporin level may increase risk nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. With concurrent administration, close monitoring of cyclosporin level is indicated with dose adjustment when needed. Azithromycin did not affect cyclosporin levels in a report involving 6 patients. (Nephron 1996:73:724). Pimozide: Possible increased in pimozide concentration, which may result in QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmia. Contraindicated by manufacturer. Do not co- administer.

PREGNANCY Risk: B - animal studies show no harm to the fetus. No human data available

Breast FeepING: Accumulates in breast milk. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers erythromycin compatible with breast feeding.

ComMeENTs: An oral and parenteral macrolide with convenient once daily dosing (half-life of 68 hrs). Expanded spectrum includes improved activity against H. influenzae compared to erythromycin. In contrast to other macrolides, azithromycin is not likely to interact with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4.

Comments: Oral 2nd generation cephalosporin that has poor activity against S. pneumoniae, and therefore is not an ideal agent in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
