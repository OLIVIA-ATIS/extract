Samples can be sent for culture of bacteria (aerobic or anaerobic), fungi, or viruses. Ideally, specimens are collected before the administration of antimicrobial therapy; in instances where this order of events is not clinically feasible, microscopic examination of the speci-men (e.g., Gram-stained or potassium hydroxide [KOH]–treated  preparations) is particularly important. Culture of the organism(s) allows identification of the etiologic agent, determination of  the antimicrobial susceptibility profile, and—when there is concern about an outbreak—isolate typing. While cultures are extremely useful in the evaluation of patients, determining whether culture results are clinically meaningful or represent contamination (e.g., a non-aureus, non-lugdunensis staphylococcal species growing in a blood culture) can sometimes be challenging and requires an understanding of the patient’s immune status, exposure history, and microbiota.

Plasmodia are injected as infective sporozo-ites from the salivary glands during mosquito feeding. Leishmania parasites are regurgitated as promastigotes from the alimentary tract of sandflies and injected by bite into a susceptible host. Trypano-somes are first ingested from infected hosts by reduviid bugs; the pathogens then multiply in the gastrointestinal tract of the insects and are released in feces onto the host’s skin during subsequent feedings. Most microbes that land directly on intact skin are des-tined to die, as survival on the skin or in hair follicles requires resis-tance to fatty acids, low pH, and other antimicrobial factors on the skin. Once it is damaged (and particularly if it becomes necrotic), the skin can be a major portal of entry and growth for pathogens and elaboration of their toxic products.

Most microbes produce multiple adhesins specific for multiple host recep-tors.

Viral coat proteins serve as the ligands for cel-lular entry, and more than one ligand-receptor interaction may be needed; for example, HIV utilizes its envelope glycoprotein (gp) 120 to enter host cells by binding both to CD4 and to one of two receptors for chemokines (designated CCR5 and CXCR4). Simi-larly, the measles virus H glycoprotein binds to both CD46 and the membrane-organizing protein moesin on host cells. The gB and gC proteins on herpes simplex virus bind to heparan sulfate, although this adherence is not essential for entry but rather serves to concen-trate virions close to the cell surface; this step is followed by attach-ment to mammalian cells mediated by the viral gD protein, with subsequent formation of a homotrimer of viral gB protein or a het-erodimer of viral gH and gL proteins that permits fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.

A notable example of the effect of host receptors on the pathogenesis of infection has emerged from studies comparing the binding of avian influenza A subtype H5N1 with that of influenza A strains expressing the H1 subtype of hemagglutinin. The H1 subtypes tend to be highly patho-genic and transmissible from human to human, and they bind to a receptor composed of two sugar molecules: sialic acid linked α-2-6 to galactose. This receptor is expressed at high levels in the airway epithelium; when virus is shed from this surface, its transmission via coughing and aerosol droplets is facilitated. In contrast, the H5N1 avian influenza virus binds to sialic acid linked α-2-3 to galactose, and this receptor is expressed at high levels in pneumocytes in the alveoli. Infection in the alveoli is thought to underlie the high mor-tality rate associated with avian influenza but also the low interhu-man transmissibility of this strain, which is not readily transported to the airways from which it can be expelled by coughing.

The skin is acidic and is bathed with fatty acids toxic to many microbes. Skin pathogens such as staphylococci must tolerate these adverse conditions. Mucosal surfaces are covered by a barrier composed of a thick mucus layer that entraps microbes and facilitates their transport out of the body by such processes as mucociliary clearance, coughing, and urination. Mucous secretions, saliva, and tears contain antibacterial factors such as lysozyme and antimicrobial peptides as well as antiviral factors such as interferons (IFNs). Gastric acidity and bile salts are inimical to the survival of many ingested pathogens, and most mucosal surfaces—particularly the nasopharynx, the vaginal tract, and the gastrointestinal tract—contain a resident flora of commensal microbes that interfere with the ability of pathogens to colonize and infect a host. Major advances in the use of nucleic acid sequencing now allow extensive identification and characterization of the vast array of commen-sal organisms that have come to be referred to as the microbiota.

This mode of growth produces structures that have been referred to as bacterial pods. It is likely that at low bacterial inocula epithelial cell ingestion and subclinical inflammation are efficient means to eliminate pathogens, while at higher inocula a proportion of surviving bacterial cells enter the host tissue through the damaged mucosal surface and multiply, producing disease. Alternatively, failure of the appropriate epithelial cell response to a pathogen may allow the organism to survive on a mucosal surface where, if it avoids other host defenses, it can grow and cause a local infection. Along these lines, as noted above, P. aeruginosa is taken into epithelial cells by CFTR, a protein missing or nonfunctional in most severe cases of cystic fibrosis. The major clinical consequence of this disease is chronic airway-surface infection with P. aeruginosa in 80–90% of patients. The failure of airway epithelial cells to ingest and promote the removal of P. aeruginosa via a properly regulated inflammatory response has been proposed as a key component of the hypersusceptibility of cystic fibrosis patients to chronic airway infection with this organism.", "bbox": [54.0, 45.6060791015625, 594.0001220703125, 236.2979278564453], "confidence": null}, {"block_id": "Harrison_s_Infectious_Diseases_p14_b1", "block_type": "text", "content": "Encounters with phagocytes", "bbox": [54.00895690917969, 249.87890625, 171.12596130371094, 261.11090087890625], "confidence": null}, {"block_id": "Harrison_s_Infectious_Diseases_p14_b2", "block_type": "text", "content": "Phagocytosis and inflammationPhagocytosis of microbes is a major innate host defense that limits the growth and spread of pathogens. Phagocytes appear rapidly at sites of infection in conjunction with the initiation of inflammation. Ingestion of microbes by both tissue-fixed macrophages and migrat-ing phagocytes probably accounts for the limited ability of most microbial agents to cause disease. A family of related molecules called collectins, soluble defense collagens, or pattern-recognition molecules are found in blood (mannose-binding lectins), in lung (surfactant proteins A and D), and most likely in other tissues as well and bind to carbohydrates on microbial surfaces to promote phagocyte clearance. Bacterial pathogens seem to be ingested prin-cipally by PMNs, while eosinophils are frequently found at sites of infection by protozoan or multicellular parasites. Successful pathogens, by definition, must avoid being cleared by professional phagocytes. One of several antiphagocytic strategies employed by bacteria and by the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is to elaborate large-molecular-weight surface polysaccharide antigens, often in the form of a capsule that coats the cell surface. Most patho-genic bacteria produce such antiphagocytic capsules. On occasion, proteins or polypeptides form capsule-like coatings for organisms such as group A streptococci and Bacillus anthracis.", "bbox": [54.008941650390625, 266.51092529296875, 302.0849304199219, 499.16070556640625], "confidence": null}, {"block_id": "Harrison_s_Infectious_Diseases_p14_b3", "block_type": "text", "content": "As activation of local phagocytes in tissues is a key step in ini-tiating inflammation and migration of additional phagocytes into infected sites, much attention has been paid to microbial factors that initiate inflammation. These are usually conserved factors critical to the microbes’ survival and are referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Cellular responses to microbial encounters with phagocytes are governed largely by the structure of the microbial PAMPs that elicit inflammation, and detailed knowl-edge of these structures of bacterial pathogens has contributed greatly to our understanding of molecular mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis mediated by activation of host cell molecules such as TLRs (Fig. 2-3). One of the best-studied systems involves the inter-action of LPS from gram-negative bacteria and the GPI-anchored membrane protein CD14 found on the surface of professional phagocytes, including migrating and tissue-fixed macrophages and PMNs. A soluble form of CD14 is also found in plasma and on mucosal surfaces. A plasma protein, LPS-binding protein, trans-fers LPS to membrane-bound CD14 on myeloid cells and promotes binding of LPS to soluble CD14. Soluble CD14/LPS/LPS-binding protein complexes bind to many cell types and may be internalized to initiate cellular responses to microbial pathogens. It has been shown that peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid from gram-positive bacteria as well as cell-surface products of mycobacteria and spiro-chetes can interact with CD14 (Fig. 2-3).

This binding is probably due to the release of the microbial surface factor from the cell in the environment of the phagosome, where the liberated factor can bind to its cognate TLRs.

Another molecular mechanism of viral virulence involves the production of peptide growth factors for host cells, which dis-rupt normal cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation. In addition, viral factors can bind to and interfere with the function of host receptors for signaling molecules. Modulation of cytokine production during viral infection can stimulate viral growth inside cells with receptors for the cytokine, and virus-encoded cytokine homologues (e.g., the Epstein-Barr virus BCRF1 protein, which is highly homologous to the immunoinhibitory IL-10 molecule) can potentially prevent immune-mediated clearance of viral particles. Viruses can cause disease in neural cells by interfering with lev-els of neurotransmitters without necessarily destroying the cells, or they may induce either programmed cell death (apoptosis) to destroy tissues or inhibitors of apoptosis to allow prolonged viral infection of cells.

Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic gram-positive organism that elaborates two tox-ins, A and B, responsible for disruption of the intestinal mucosa when organism numbers expand in the intestine, leading to antibiotic-associated diarrhea and potentially to pseudomem-branous colitis. Enterotoxins produced by E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, and V. cholerae contribute to diarrheal disease caused by these organisms.

Further, it offers the possibility of entirely new approaches to disease prevention and treatment, including regenerative medicine, which involves administration of microbial species (probiotics) to individuals harboring communities that have not developed into a mature, fully functional state or that have been perturbed in ways that can be restored by the addition of species that fill unoccupied “jobs” (niches).", "bbox": [323.9970397949219, 397.6082763671875, 572.0823364257812, 672.32421875], "confidence": null}, {"block_id": "Harrison_s_Infectious_Diseases_p20_b7", "block_type": "text", "content": "This chapter provides a general overview of how human micro-bial communities are analyzed; reviews ecologic principles that guide our understanding of microbial communities in health and disease; summarizes recent studies that establish correlations and, in some cases, causal relationships between our microbiota/microbiomes and various diseases; and discusses challenges faced in the translation of these findings to new therapeutic interventions.", "bbox": [323.9970397949219, 670.6862182617188, 572.072998046875, 745.84521484375], "confidence": null}, {"block_id": "Harrison_s_Infectious_Diseases_p20_b8", "block_type": "text", "content": "THE HUMAN MICROBIOME", "bbox": [182.46530151367188, 147.93798828125, 441.5423278808594, 173.17999267578125], "confidence": null}, {"block_id": "Harrison_s_Infectious_Diseases_p20_b9", "block_type": "text", "content": "CHAPTER 3", "bbox": [248.3955078125, 111.91497802734375, 375.42449951171875, 138.64797973632812], "confidence": null}], "tables": [], "images": [{"image_id": "img_0", "filename": "page_20_img_0.png", "bbox": [0, 2042, 1945, 1], "size": [2042, 1945]}], "metadata": {"total_blocks": 10, "total_tables": 0, "total_images": 1, "page_size": {"width": 612.0, "height": 783.3599853515625}}}
