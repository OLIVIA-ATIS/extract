Structure exemplifies stated relationshipsor framework, and process deals with interaction. There arethree key elements of organization: the tasks to be per-formed, the individuals who are to perform the tasks, andthe clinical laboratory as a workplace.A scope of services document provides a detailed list ofservices provided by the microbiology laboratory. The docu-ment should contain general information on the hours oflaboratory operation and on staffing. It may also includetest-specific information such as specimen collection andtransport requirements, reference ranges, locations of testing,(in-house versus reference laboratories), and cutoff times forreceipt of specimens. The scope of services provided by thelaboratory is often a reflection of the type of hospital or facil-ity it serves.Organizational charts are common to most business struc-tures as they provide a visualization of who is doing what andthe chain of command. Although nobody likes to think ofoneself as being below other people, these charts can serve auseful purpose in the clinical laboratory by defining the rela-tionships among tasks, individuals, and the workplace. Theorganizational chart attempts to show relationships betweenline and staff. A line position is one in which a superior exer-cises direct supervision over a subordinate. A staff position isadvisory, supportive, or auxiliary. These terms were defined inindustry, and health care institutions seldom use the sameconnotation. When laboratory managers speak of staff, theyare usually referring to technologists who are, in fact, servingin line positions.Written policies and procedures, displayed in printedmanuals or made available electronically, are an essentialcomponent of the clinical microbiology laboratory. Everyprocedure should be clear, easy to follow, and consistent inits content and organization. These documents providedirection for the many day-to-day tasks performed by thestaff, serve as a teaching tool for students and new employ-ees, and provide information to inspectors from accreditingagencies. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute(formerly NCCLS) has a published guideline, GP2-A4, forwriting laboratory procedures (23). The guideline providesinstructions and recommendations for writing procedures forthe full scope of the laboratory’s workflow. The documentalso contains information about organizing procedure man-uals, archiving and managing documents, and using manu-facturers’ procedures for automated purposes. As a testamentto the document’s universal acceptance, the College ofAmerican Pathologists requires that all written laboratoryprocedures closely follow the GP2-A4 format.As defined by Brown (4), process design is a broad planthat is developed to provide a blueprint for completing workor a task at hand. Process design in the clinical microbiologylaboratory involves an analysis of size and setting, laboratorydesign, equipment, test methodology, regulations, and staffing.How the work transitions through the laboratory is defined asworkflow, and although workflow analysis is part of processdesign, it is more detailed. Policies and procedures are devel-oped during workflow analysis (4). Workflow can be dividedinto three phases of the test cycle: preanalytical, analytical,and postanalytical. The preanalytical phase consists of eventsthat occur prior to actual testing, such as selection, collection,transport, and accessioning of specimens.

The postanalytical phase consistsof events that occur after testing is completed, such as resultsreporting and interpretation. The preanalytical phase is oftenthe most critical aspect of the test cycle and can be the hard-est part of workflow to control.Strategies to effectively manage and minimize variancesassociated with the three phases of the test cycle should beincluded in the clinical laboratory’s quality managementplan. Quality management is a system for continuously ana-lyzing, improving, and reexamining resources, processes, andservices within an organization to produce the best possibleoutcome (28). Microbiologists have, for many years, con-cerned themselves with the quality of events that take placewithin the clinical microbiology laboratory. These eventsinclude such things as ensuring the performance of equip-ment, reagents, stains, and media and monitoring the accu-racy of tests performed in the laboratory. These activities fall under the category of quality control (QC). Qualityassurance (QA) broadens the scope of traditional QC toencompass processes and events in the preanalytical andpostanalytical phases. QA includes such things as determin-ing specimen quality and evaluating the competency andtraining of personnel. Both QC and QA can be consideredaspects of quality management that also includes qualityimprovement (QI) or quality enhancement. Althoughapplied successfully in industry for many years, QI and qual-ity enhancement are relatively recent concepts in the clini-cal laboratory setting. Instead of focusing on inspection,identifying poor performance, and taking corrective action,as in traditional QC and QA programs, QI programs empha-size thorough training and prevention and view the systemfor improvement opportunities rather than the people (8).Continuous QI (CQI), sometimes referred to as total qualitymanagement, is an organized, systematic approach to pro-ductivity improvement that uses objective methods and ateam approach toward improving the quality of all processes,products, and services. The origin of CQI-total quality man-agement is industry based. The approach was promulgatedby W. Edwards Deming and grew out of his experience withJapan’s industrial reconstruction after World War II. Centralto CQI philosophy is the premise that improvement in qual-ity leads to increased productivity, increased customer andemployee satisfaction, and decreased cost. The CQI approachis to examine process performance, not people performance,and utilize specific methods of analysis (tools) to betterunderstand and improve those processes. It is a top-downstyle of QI that requires management commitment and sup-port and involves the participation of all employees. Finally,CQI is viewed as an ongoing initiative.While these broad definitions may suggest that CQI wouldbe an ideal QI technique for the clinical laboratory, its imple-mentation in clinical laboratories has not been easy. This isdue, in part, to the additional time and resource requirementsassociated with CQI, at least initially, but also relates to aninsufficient understanding of how to properly apply CQI tolaboratory testing. CQI requires innovative thinking; the tra-ditional internal quality monitors familiar to most laboratoriescannot simply be shoehorned into a CQI format. Above all,do not lose sight of the fundamental objective: to improvepatient care.One way for laboratories to avoid this pitfall is to design aCQI program that strives to connect process improvement toclinically relevant patient outcome measures.

Outcomes measurementidentifies variations that may adversely affect patient care andcan sometimes determine corrective actions for minimizingthose variations. Although patient outcomes come in manyforms, measurements relevant to laboratory testing generallyinvolve the length of stay, cost, and customer satisfaction,with the customer being both the patient and the physician.Changes in laboratory services and policies that decreaselengths of patient stays, reduce cost, or increase customer sat-isfaction should be the focus of a laboratory CQI program.Those that have the most impact on outcome measuresshould be selected for process improvement.A process is a set of activities that transforms inputs intooutputs. Inputs include the needs of patients and physicians,the skill of laboratory personnel, equipment, supplies, andfinancial resources. Outputs involve laboratory data, diag-noses, and management decisions that are associated withoutcomes realized by patients and physicians. Process analy-sis is often accomplished with techniques such as flowchart-ing and the use of cause-and-effect diagrams (fishbones),i.e., the tools of CQI, but it is important to remember thatthe goal of process analysis is to design strategies wherebymodifications of the process lead to a measurable improve-ment in outcome. In clinical microbiology, elements ofprocesses that may be selected for analysis and improvementinclude specimen rejection criteria, appropriateness of test-ing, and turnaround times for smear results that acutelyaffect patient management. Process analysis should includeevents related to the patient from the time of presentationto the end of an episode of care. For the laboratory, thisrequires an understanding of how multiple processes relatedto patient care, including those external to the laboratory,are connected (the output of one process may be the inputof another). Failure to understand the interactive dynamicbetween processes will likely blunt the impact of laboratoryimprovement initiatives on patient outcomes.A critical feature of the CQI paradigm is the need tocarefully construct and assess any improvement modalitybefore implementing costly changes in policies or procedureson a large scale. Referred to as the Plan-Do-Study-Act cyclefor improvement (5, 17), the steps include first stating a spe-cific aim and identifying criteria that will be used to deter-mine if the change represents an improvement. Afterselection of a change that is practical and most predictive ofa positive effect, a plan for evaluating the change in the formof a small pilot study is put forth. The results of the pilotstudy are assessed for their effect on performance, and thenaction is taken in the form of process redesign, or if needed,additional pilot studies are conducted.

Thisfixed reimbursement system and incentive to reduce the costof care has put pressure on hospital support services such asthe laboratory to lower expenses.Medicare Part B covers physician services and outpatientancillary health care services including clinical laboratorytesting. In July 2000, Medicare introduced a new PPS for theoutpatient setting and developed ambulatory payment classi-fications as a basis for reimbursement for outpatient services.The ambulatory payment classification system provides pay-ment predictability and promotes efficiency; however, at thistime clinical laboratory tests are excluded from the outpatientPPS. Instead, laboratory tests performed on outpatients arepaid for from the Medicare Part B laboratory fee schedule.Fees are assigned based on current procedural terminology(CPT-4) or health care common procedure coding system(HCPCS) codes established for each procedure. The actualMedicare payment is the lowest of either the actual charge,the fee schedule amount set by the contractor, or the nationalfee cap termed the national limitation amount (la).Private insurers, also affected by increasing health carecosts, have also undergone revision in their reimbursementmethodologies. Managed care is defined as a means of provid-ing health care services within a network of service providers(6).

Clinical service line managers, inparticular, should communicate new program plans to supportservice managers, including laboratory managers, becausesupport services may be impacted by these new programs. If,for example, the hospital has plans to begin performinghuman stem cell transplants, then the microbiology laboratoryneeds to budget for the additional volume and specializedtesting that patients receiving these transplants will require.In return, managers may be required to provide the laboratoryand/or hospital administration with information related toprogram changes anticipated in their areas that arise becauseof changes in technology or clinical practice. Examples of suchchanges include procedures that may diminish in volumebecause of obsolescence or physician education and increas-ing volume estimates for newly implemented procedures suchas those of molecular diagnostics.There are several types of operating budgets (18). A fixedbudget assumes a single level of output or activity and buildsthe budget around that level. A fixed budget, however, can-not be used to monitor and control resources during changesin test volumes that the laboratory may experience during theyear. A flexible budget reflects expected laboratory revenueand expenses and anticipates the impact of volume changeson both. In this type of budget, some of the expenses arefixed and some are variable.

If thelaboratory is considered part of ancillary services, then thenumbers of available dollars is much lower than the overallbudget and the laboratory will likely be competing with sev-eral other departments for this lesser amount. The evalua-tion process will seek to classify capital projects in differentways, and managers should be aware of how to appropriatelycategorize and describe any project submitted for considera-tion. For example, some projects may represent new or incre-mental business, some may enhance quality, and some mayreduce cost. Finally, capital requests may be prioritized accord-ing to need. A nondiscretionary project is a project that mustbe funded to keep the facility operating. An example would bea renovation project to make the laboratory compliant withregulatory and accreditation mandates. Levels of priority thenfollow, with level I projects being most critical.Generally, capital projects of $10,000 or less need mini-mal analysis. All that is normally required is a brief des-cription of the project and its intended use (new item or replacement, etc.) and the requested dollar amount.Projects with costs exceeding the minimum dollar amountrequire a higher level of analysis and more detailed docu-mentation supporting the request. In addition to a descrip-tion of the project and its intended use, proposals for theseprojects should include an estimate of the life span of theitem, an estimate of all costs associated with acquisition, an estimate of yearly incremental cash outflows, and an estimate of yearly incremental cash inflows or savings.Depreciation expense must also be considered. Straight-linedepreciation analysis is the most commonly used method ofdetermining the expense of a fixed asset. In this method, theestimated useful life span of the item is divided by the cost ofacquisition. A piece of equipment costing $100,000 with auseful life expectancy of 5 years would have a depreciationexpense of $20,000 per year.The financial analysis of large capital projects may haveseveral elements. An illustrative case study follows. Supposea clinical microbiology laboratory that has historically performed manual bacterial identifications and disk suscep-tibility tests wishes to purchase an automated system becausea new outreach program will significantly increase test volumes. First, a pay-back analysis reveals that with a pur-chase price of $125,000 and a net cash flow of $137,000 after3 years, the pay-back period is calculated at 2.68 years. Thepay-back method does not take into account the time valueof money but serves as a crude measure of risk because itfavors projects with a short pay-back horizon. The averagerate of return is calculated by dividing the average annualreturn by the amount of the initial investment. Projects witha higher average rate of return may be rated more favorably,but the method also fails to recognize the impact of time. Theconcept of present value is very important for capital invest-ment analyses because it takes into account the increase ordecrease in the value of a capital investment over time.The most common method used in the financial analysisof a capital proposal that accounts for the time value ofmoney is the calculation of net present value (NPV). NPVis the present value of all cash flows minus the initial invest-ment. If the NPV is positive or zero, the project is usually con-sidered financially acceptable.

Financial bench marking is but oneof many tools that the laboratory employs to improve per-formance, focus on customers, survive, and thrive in anenvironment with limited resources (39). In selecting indi-cators for bench marking, the use of ratios is much preferredover the use of raw numbers because the data are viewed interms of a common denominator, usually some unit of ser-vice. The typical unit of service for the laboratory is the billedtest because most financial systems are capturing volumesaccording to CPT codes that have standardized character-istics. A denominator that is often used outside the labora-tory is patient-days or patient discharges. Ratios can be usedto assess performance in a number of ways. For example, lab-oratory workload may be measured by calculating the totalnumber of billed tests per calendar day, per patient-day, orper patient discharge, and examining the number of billedtests per full time equivalent reveals service intensity. Laborproductivity can be determined from the number of hoursworked per 100 billed tests or per patient discharge. Lastly,important cost data may be ascertained from ratios such aslabor and supply expenses per 100 billed tests.The simplest method of bench marking is to use your ownlaboratory as the standard and measure performance overtime. This type of internal bench marking provides consis-tency of measurement over time and gives managers controlover assumptions. In effect, it affords managers a means tocontinuously monitor performance and make improvementsin productivity and cost on an ongoing basis. External benchmarking involves a comparison of the laboratory’s perfor-mance with that of a peer group. The composition of the peergroup is critical. Members of the peer group should be alikein as many critical characteristics as possible. Otherwise,whatever performance expectations are placed on an indi-vidual laboratory being compared to the peer group may beunreasonable. Sometimes, voluntary agreements are estab-lished with other institutions to share productivity and costinformation. This arrangement allows control of the size andcomposition of the peer group and ensures a fair comparisonof whatever characteristics are being measured.

The ultimate goal is to provide themicrobiology administrator with a qualified pool of candi-dates while trying to maintain workforce diversity accordingto a U.S. DOL directive (http://www.dol.gov/dol/compliance/comp-eeo.htm). For individuals applying for supervisory orhigher positions, a search committee should be convened toexpand the sources of potential candidates. Once a can-didate pool of qualified individuals has been identified, it istime to begin the interview process.The interview is a means of allowing the employer andcandidate to determine whether they are suited for eachother. It is a very important process because a badly con-ducted interview may scare off a highly qualified candidate.This is also the part of the hiring process in which theunskilled interviewer may pose a liability and one thatrequires close attention to regulations. There are severalquestions shown in Table 2 that the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission prevents an employer from askinga potential employee (14, 16, 35, 38). The interview shouldbe organized and standardized to permit a fair evaluation ofeach candidate. There are three basic formats for an inter-view: structured, in which the format is predetermined witha list of questions and a review form; unstructured, in whicha set panel of questions is not used but the interview consistsprimarily of a running conversation with the candidate; andpressurized, in which the candidate is asked to provideanalysis of various job-related scenarios or to solve a series ofhypothetical problems (34). The interview can be a combi-nation of all three and can be conducted individually or bya panel of interviewers. In some organizations, HR conductsa preliminary interview to screen candidates before themicrobiology administration conducts final interviews. Theultimate goals are to meet the candidate, check credentials(usually an HR responsibility), collect additional informa-tion not provided on the application form, and gather asense of personality fit. In management, we tend to think ofthe interview process from one side only.

The first is at the organizational levelto familiarize the new employee with institutional policies,procedures, and benefits. The second focuses on department-specific policies and codes of conduct. The final aspect con-centrates on the microbiology laboratory and addresses jobresponsibilities, reporting structure, and working relationshipsthat exist therein. There are at least four basic approachesto conducting orientation (16, 34). These include (i) for-mal meetings and training sessions, usually conducted at theinstitutional level by HR (these cover such topics as risk man-agement, fire and chemical safety, benefits, and infection control); (ii) microbiology supervisor-led sessions to discusslaboratory-specific issues such as competency assessment, bio-logical safety protocols, dress code, telephone conduct,breaks, and scheduling; (iii) a checklist approach; and (iv) amentor-driven process.In addition to a systemwide, general orientation pro-gram, many microbiology managers choose to develop astepwise laboratory-specific orientation process that ischecklist driven. First is the preorientation checklist, whichis preparatory in nature. It allows the microbiology supervi-sory staff to organize all the materials that the newemployee will receive during orientation.

It requires advanced planning, and no onestrategy works for every facility because peak activity levels,workloads, and the technical complexity of testing differ sig-nificantly. Poor planning can lead to low productivity and highlabor costs when staffing is excessive. Inadequate staffing maygenerate high productivity but also lead to increased overtimeand employee burnout (21). To avoid these extremes, a num-ber of good guidelines on staffing and scheduling are availablefor review (4, 36).Scheduling is simply the process of assigning workresponsibilities to a group of individuals and requires theright number of employees and skill levels to complete thework. Most medical laboratories work under the 8/80 rulefor full-time employees, i.e., employees work a total of 8 hper day and 10 days over a 2-week pay period. This plan lim-its the number of hours to be worked in a day but permits theemployee to work more consecutive days and is unique tomedical facilities. A 40-h work week permits an employee towork any number of hours per day but not to exceed 40 h perweek. Other scheduling systems include the use of part- orvariable-time help, job sharing, self-directed work teams,and exempted employees (21, 36). In designing a schedule,it is important to choose a plan or combination of plans toprovide the greatest degree of flexibility. A mixture ofemployees on the 8/80 plan and the 40 plan can be used, buta single employee must choose only one option.The scheduler must know workload patterns and futuretrends. This is most often done retrospectively by reviewingLIS-generated billing for an estimate of test volume and plot-ting these data over time for trend analysis for each shift.Recording workload units periodically over time can also pro-vide a helpful bench mark of test volume. However, keepingpace with method advancement is also necessary for project-ing future labor needs. The development of molecular andamplification technology has greatly streamlined a number ofprocesses in the microbiology laboratory––most significantlyin clinical virology. Armed with this information, the labora-tory manager must calculate how many people for each shiftand skill set will accommodate the mean test volume, notpeak or trough volumes of work (4). From here, the schedulerstarts with a rough draft based on ideal staffing levels by usinga matrix for each shift where rows correspond with the ser-vices to be provided and columns represent the days of the pay period. With the 8/80 plan, a shift is 8 h times  14 days or 112 h per pay period. Full-time employees can cover 80 ofthese hours (8 h times 10 days), while part-time staff can beused to fill in the balance (generally 24 h per week or less).Once a rough schedule has been outlined, it can be fine tunedby naming the individuals who will fill each slot and the workassigned. From this working draft, the schedule can be modi-fied to accommodate vacations, family leave, illness, earnedtime off, and shift switching. Schedulers and managers mustalso remember that work schedules affect employee familiesand morale (30). Part-time and variable-time employees canbe used to fill in gaps, or cross shift coverage can be applied torelieve peak workload stress. A detailed description of thisprocess can be found elsewhere (4, 30, 36). During newemployee orientation, a review of the scheduling processshould be included so that there are no surprises when theindividual is eventually assigned duties.Winn and Westenfeld (41) provide an excellent summaryof scheduling do’s and don’ts as follows: (i) define the", "bbox": [37.86000061035156, 61.459014892578125, 268.12774658203125, 723.3002319335938], "confidence": null}, {"block_id": "Manual_of_Clinical_Microbiology_p16_b1", "block_type": "text", "content": "absolute minimum number of employees required for eachsituation (weekends, routine, and holidays); (ii) strictlydefine the duties for each of the positions required for everytype of shift, and if a position is open, try to fill it with exist-ing personnel based on the duties assigned to that slot;(iii) allow scheduling to be orchestrated by a coordinator withinput from the staff; (iv) solicit vacation requests well inadvance (\u00026 months) and be clear that not all preferencescan be accommodated; (v) publish work schedules inadvance to allow for personal adjustments; (vi) if allowed,use earned time off instead of overtime; and (vii) fill emptyslots with volunteers or part-time help, with a draft as a lastresort. In this context, certain laboratories have developed arotational “hit list” among staff to cover for open slots on thework schedule. The next person up on the list is informed oftheir standing and allowed one deferral or may switch theirobligation with another employee.In a situation in which the microbiology workload is highor increasing and staffing is static or decreasing, there are afew options left to the administration to relieve the pressure.The first of these is outsourcing, such as finding reference lab-oratories to perform a variety of low-volume, esoteric, or tech-nically complex testing, e.g., forwarding all mycobacterialidentifications with the exception of probe-confirmed identi-fication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacteriumavium complex organisms to a public health mycobacteriologylaboratory. Elimination of low-volume testing may not neces-sarily prove to be cost efficient but maintaining proficiencywhen the frequency of testing is low should also factor intooutsourcing decisions.Microbiology laboratories can even outsource testing toother laboratories within their own system. For example, auto-mated blood culture systems can be physically located near arapid-response laboratory. Signal-positive blood cultures canthen be removed during all shifts to be subcultured andstained. Gram stains can be read by trained rapid-responsetechnologists, and cultures can be evaluated during the nextmicrobiology shift.The second option is to examine the extent of evalua-tion. In many instances, microbiology laboratories can getinto the bad habit of providing too much information, suchas identifying isolated organisms that are unlikely pathogensin a disease process. This process not only generates anunnecessary workload but may also give the clinician a falsesense of importance.Unfortunately, staffing and scheduling often go hand inhand with absenteeism. As a result, each facility should havea well-defined absentee policy and management plan that areneither onerous to the employee nor subjective and that canbe fairly applied. A laboratory policy on absenteeism requires aworking definition, equitable and realistic standards (e.g., lessthan one unscheduled absence per month), and a manage-ment plan that uses the same organizational framework forcorrective action for issues such as behavioral or performanceproblems (36). Absenteeism can be chronic, high frequency,and/or patterned (e.g., Mondays, Fridays, or the day after pay-day). If not addressed and corrected, chronic absenteeism cangenerate poor morale among other microbiology staff.", "bbox": [283.859619140625, 61.31365966796875, 511.9877014160156, 640.7793579101562], "confidence": null}, {"block_id": "Manual_of_Clinical_Microbiology_p16_b2", "block_type": "text", "content": "Performance AppraisalA job description defines the duties of an employee and howthe employee’s success will be measured.

Basically, four markers can be measured eitheralone or in combination to generate a performance appra-isal: results, behavior, skills, and peer comparison (33).However, objectivity in performance appraisal is often diffi-cult to achieve. We all have a tendency to rate individualswe like highly and those we do not like less highly.

As is the case with many pieces of federal legislation,CLIA ’88 did not define how this process is to be accom-plished nor did they suggest which core competencies shouldbe monitored. They did, however, place the responsibility forestablishing a program and documenting competency assess-ment squarely on the shoulders of the laboratory director andtechnical consultant or technical supervisor (11). Fortunately,the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerlyNCCLS) has published a clear and logical approach to thedesign of a laboratory-based training and competency assess-ment program that provides a wealth of sample documentsused in the process (22).

That being said, there are at least three excellentpublications outlining a competency assessment programspecifically for the microbiology laboratory, and any of thesecould be used as a template for design (19, 20, 29). Generallaboratory-wide plans are also available for review (16, 22).In one model, a database in a spreadsheet format (e.g., anExcel file) is established for each active employee upon hire.All of the potential competencies that the job descriptionencompasses are listed in the first column of the spreadsheet(y axis), and the first row (x axis) indicates the year ofreview. Each new employee begins with a series of X’s ineach competency cell for which training has not yet beenconducted or in the cells corresponding to competencies notincluded in the job description. As training for a particularskill is accomplished, the X is removed and the method ofmeasurement, the date, and the initials of the trainer orobserver are recorded in the cell. Methods of measurementcan be coded as DO for direct observation, Q for quiz, DR fordocument review, PT for proficiency test (internal or exter-nal), PM for preventive maintenance review, and QC forquality control review, etc. By using the spreadsheet approach,the competency assessment report for each employee is read-ily available for review and update and can also be used as anorientation tool. A copy of each report can be printed on ayearly basis and added to the employee’s personal file.", "bbox": [283.859619140625, 61.3359375, 511.9638977050781, 460.805419921875], "confidence": null}, {"block_id": "Manual_of_Clinical_Microbiology_p17_b4", "block_type": "text", "content": "Continuing EducationThe Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelineson training and competence assessment distinguish betweentraining and education in the following way (22).

The departure of an employeefrom the workplace can be either amicable or contentious.In any case, procedures are usually developed by HR foremployee separation that reflect the situation. For voluntaryand amicable termination, the process may include docu-mentation of the date of departure and a forwarding address;discontinuation of payroll, benefits, and parking privileges;and the return of security materials. HR may also wish toconduct an exit interview with the employee to gain insighton laboratory operations and administration (34).There are good reasons to support the involuntary termi-nation of an employee, including incompetence, chronicabsences, violent behavior or verbal abuse, falsification ofresume, theft, and insubordination (16). A fair employer willmake every reasonable attempt to correct the problem priorto taking disciplinary actions. Detriments to job perfor-mance including substance abuse of any kind, stress-relatedillness, mental illness, or physical disabilities secondary tojob activities fall under the auspices of the Americans withDisabilities Act (http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/adahom1.htm)and are not acceptable causes for dismissal (16). A numberof variations in the process of progressive disciplinary actionhave been described for laboratory managers, and each isdesigned to allow sufficient time for the employee in ques-tion to mend his or her ways and for the employer to ade-quately assess the true nature of the situation (16, 34, 38).The steps generally include (i) verbal counseling, (ii) writtencounseling, (iii) a penalty phase, and (iv) dismissal. A num-ber of variations on the theme exist. Walters (38) outlines amore creative approach to the resolution or terminationprocess that includes five phases: forewarning, investigation,proof, reflection, and penalty. Importantly, though, employ-ees have the right to representation during any disciplinaryprocess as determined by the National Labor Relations Act(http://www.nlrb.gov/nlrb/legal/manuals/rules/act.asp). Ifthe conclusions of the progressive disciplinary action lead toemployee dismissal, the process is usually handled by HR toensure that all legal steps are followed and documented (16).It is also wise for the employer to retain the personnel file ofthe departing employee for future reference. Likewise, thedeparting employee should be informed of the ConsolidatedOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.

The intention is to ensure the accuracy, reliability,and timeliness of test results no matter which laboratory isperforming the testing. They were signed into law in 1988(12), but five successive final revisions of the initial legislationhave been published since, the last of which appeared in theFederal Register in 2003 (13, 34). In the first final version ofCLIA, laboratory testing was divided into three complexitylevels that established the expertise level of personnel per-forming those tests. Those levels were waived, moderate com-plexity (including provider-performed microscopy), and highcomplexity. In the most recent final version of CLIA, testingis now lumped into waived and nonwaived tests (most of thelatter were high complexity). However, relative to the qualifi-cations of testing personnel, CLIA still recognize moderate-and high-complexity levels (7, 40).The administration and implementation of CLIA areunder the purview of the CMS (http://www.cms.hhs.gov) incollaboration with the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention (http://www.cdc.gov). The U.S. Food and DrugAdministration (http://www.fda.gov) is responsible for clas-sifying the complexity of laboratory testing protocols and theCMS set fee schedules for laboratories providing services toMedicare.U.S. laboratories wishing to perform and receive compen-sation for testing of human specimens must apply for a CLIAcertificate in one of three complexity categories. If the labora-tory meets compliance criteria as judged by the CMS or byone of the recognized professional accreditation agencies, itreceives a permanent certificate of compliance or accredita-tion and becomes subject to the rules, regulations, and inspec-tions of the agency issuing the certification. Organizationsthat the CMS have deemed suitable for CLIA accreditation of laboratories include the Joint Commission on Accredita-tion of Healthcare Organizations (http://www.jcaho.org), theLaboratory Accreditation Program of the College of AmericanPathologists (http://www.cap.org/apps/cap.portal), and theCommission on Office Laboratory Accreditation (http://www.cola.org/).CLIA lay the foundation for laboratory participation in aproficiency testing program, qualifications of and compe-tency assessment of laboratory personnel, and, establish-ment of a QC and QA program and ensure the integrity oflaboratory testing through all phases of testing. They alsocall for routine inspection of certified laboratories and theenforcement of penalties for laboratories found to be non-compliant. CLIA dictate that outside or reference laborato-ries to which specimens are referred from a U.S. health careinstitution also be CLIA certified or the equivalent.

Details are available athttp://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/finalreg.html. The PrivacyRule dictates that all “covered entities” including healthinsurance plans and health care institutions and providersmust obtain written permission from a patient to use or dis-close PHI and that the patients must be notified of theirright to restrict the use of or disclose PHI (24). Coveredentities must also make every attempt to limit PHI disclosureto only that required for any given purpose. From the stand-point of the microbiology laboratory, this means that therelease of any PHI attached to bacterial or fungal isolates sentfor research or surveillance purposes that can be traced in anyway to the patient requires disclosure and consent unlesswaived by the human studies committee of the institution.The Privacy Rule does not supersede the federal “CommonRule” (see also http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm) that mandates Institutional ReviewBoard approval of research studies conducted under its aus-pices (24).
